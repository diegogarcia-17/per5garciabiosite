	<img src="../images/giphy.gif" width="350" height="200" alt=""/>On this page, I used HTML to create the structure, to make a header, nav, main and footer. I created a title saying "My first website" and then added a picture behind it using divs and styles. I also added little gifs to the main page by using folder/ image.jpg, once I did that I worked on all of the outside like the two colums, margin and padding, link list which is just adjusting all of the links together. Hi, my name is Diego Garcia. I’m a student at El Camino High School, and I’m passionate about soccer, music, and especially graphic design, branding, and web design. I enjoy learning about marketing because it helps me connect creativity with real-world ideas. A lot of my inspiration comes from nature, sunsets, food, and the simple things in life. Whether I’m working late on a new project or out on the soccer field, I’m always looking for ways to grow and express myself through creativity.
