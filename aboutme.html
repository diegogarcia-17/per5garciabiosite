<p> On this page, I focused more on embedding video, styling nav botttons and styling images. Also added 2-3 short paragraphs that include my skills in web design and graphic design and also include my interests. I used nav/padding/border/radius for buttons of style CCS. The images that were added are intereest about what i like and what i like to do in my free time.</p>
<p>Soccer’s a huge part of my life, and I play at a pretty high level. I love the competition, the grind, and the way the game pushes me to keep getting better. Honestly, there’s nothing like the feeling of being out on the field. 
<p>For me, it’s not just about winning but it’s about putting in the work and being there for my team. I like the challenge of tough games and how they bring out the best in me. At the end of the day, I just enjoy playing the sport I love.</p>

  Outside of soccer, I’m always down to try new things if they grab my interest. Sometimes I’ll stick with them, sometimes I won’t, but I like giving things a shot. You never really know what you’ll end up enjoying until you try.</p>
